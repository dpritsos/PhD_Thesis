World wide web is constantly increasing and people use information in web-pages for everyday activities. There is an emerging need for facilitating access in this huge repository in a seamless way that is in accordance with users' understanding. Genre is an important factor to characterize the properties of web-pages. Web genres (e.g., blogs, e-shop, FAQs, etc.) refer to the form, structure, and communicative purpose of web-pages rather than their topic. Web Genre Identification (WGI) provides a means to improve effectiveness of information retrieval systems by allowing sophisticated queries combining topic and genre information and ranking/grouping search results according to genre. Specialized document collections can be compiled by adopting genre-aware focused crawling. The credibility assessment of web-pages can be significantly enhanced given that information about their genre is available. Cyber-security applications like anti-phishing can also be enhanced by incorporating genre of web-pages. In case natural language technology tools should be applied to the textual part of web-pages, knowing their genre allows the selection of appropriate tools that have been trained to handle similar documents. 

Existing work in WGI largely follows the closed-set classification scenario where given a genre palette and training examples for each known genre the task is to assign every new web-page to one of the known genres. However, this does not fit most of applications related to WGI. There is no consensus about the definition of a large genre palette covering most of the Web. It should be expected that large volumes of web-pages will not belong to any of the pre-defined genre labels. This could be viewed as noise in WGI. In addition, genres evolve in time, new genres emerge and existing genres are modified (e.g., blogs and micro-blogs). It seems reasonable to adopt the open-set scenario to better deal with WGI tasks. The very few existing studies focusing on open-set WGI lack an objective evaluation that will reveal their true potential.

\newpage

In this thesis, we develop three open-set WGI methods. One follows the one-class classification paradigm (OCSVM) where only positive examples of a target class are used during training. Another follows the ensemble learning paradigm (RFSE) and applies random subspacing to avoid the curse of dimensionality. The third approach is a modification of k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (NNDR) that attempts to regulate the open-space risk (i.e., the area that lies away of positive examples of a class could be occupied by another, unknown, class). In addition, we examine several text representation methods including low-level and language-independent features like character n-grams and word n-grams and syntactic features like part-of-speech n-grams. We also introduce the use of distributed representations obtained by neural network language models in WGI.

Another major contribution of this thesis is the evaluation framework we propose for open-set WGI methods. In contrast to previous approaches in this field, we focus on both unstructured and structured noise. The former means that noise is composed by a random collection of web-pages without any information about their genre. The latter assumes that noise consists of web-pages of certain genres. We adopt open-set evaluation measures, variants of the well-known precision, recall, and $F_1$ measures, excluding true positives of the unknown class. In addition, we use graphical evaluation measures that depict the performance of the examined methods in varying conditions. We also introduce the use of the openness test in WGI studies allowing to control the homogeneity of noise and the difficulty of the task.

A series of experiments is conducted to evaluate the proposed WGI methods using the open-set evaluation framework when both unstructured and structured noise is available. The ensemble-based approach (RFSE) achieved the best overall results demonstrating its ability to handle high-dimensional and sparse representations. NNDR is significantly improved when coupled with distributed representations that provide compact and dense vectors. This method is quite competitive especially when special emphasis is put on precision rather than recall. This is important given that several WGI applications (e.g., ranking of search results) prefer to optimize precision. The one-class learning approach (OCSVM) in general is not competitive. However, it surpasses RFSE for high openness scores, that is when very few known genres are available and noise is quite heterogeneous. Several ideas for further improving the obtained results are discussed.

%The \textit{Web's Contexts Genres} computational identification is a subject where due to the advances of \textit{Machine Learning} research and technologies, created a fruitful environment for rejuvenating the interest of its research. The \textit{Identification of  the Genus} of the texts is a ascent task assigned to the Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval research, since they have been digitized. In an attempt resolve the ambiguity of the Genus-taxonomy of the texts, it has been distinguished to the Genre, Register, Domain, ... taxonomies. In contrast to the others, Genre-taxonomy is more closely related to \textit{the style and the purpose} of the texts rather than their context. 

%Since the explosion of the World Wide Web (a.k.a The Web) and the tremendous rate of context daily generation redefined and also is perpendicular to their Topic-taxonomy was the main issue. However, the scaling raised for more sophisticated approaches to handle the size of the information and increase the relevance of a potential query. \textit{Automated Web Genre Identification} can benefit all the advances of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval by providing rich descriptions of the web documents, by narrowing the features, thus the vector, space for a Machine Learning algorithm to operate pattern recognition on texts and potentially help on building  more sophisticated data-structure such as the \textit{Ontology-Schemes}.

%The contribution of this work on the field of Automated Web Genre Identification is mainly the establishment of a framework towards to its research as an open-set classification problem and the outcome to be valuable for realistic and practical applications. Particularly in this study the notion of the Noise is established, the proper evaluation methodology for AGI tasks has discovered. Most importantly two new machine learning algorithms has been build as an evolutionary step of their original versions. These algorithms are clearly showing that the feature selection and dimentionality reduction is closely tight to the model induction for the this task.

%Finally, one will find the new avenues for improving the research on the field and understand the mechanics ruling the process of \textit{genre taxonomy evolution }and its \textit{characteristic temporal attribute}.
